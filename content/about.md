Welcome to Sidings Media, a giant excuse to make a website and play with
cool tech. Have an explore, see what you can find and maybe you might
learn some stuff along the way.

I should probably introduce myself, I'm Zoe (they/she) and Sidings
Media is basically my own personal playground for all things computery.
It was created all the way back in 2018 when I wanted to create YouTube
videos about model railways (hence the name). Safe to say they were
absolutely terrible (go try find them if you like!) but the name stuck.
These days Sidings Media is mainly just a name for me to group a bunch
of vaguely related projects under, like my connections to [DN42](#dn42)
and this [website](#website).

So, what am I interested in? The short answer, pretty much anything to
do with networking and cyber security. I build a home lab to play with a
bunch of ex-enterprise kit and learnt pretty much everything I know
about networking there.

So that's Sidings Media, hope you have a look around and see what you
can learn :)
