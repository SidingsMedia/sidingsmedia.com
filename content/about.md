Welcome to Sidings Media, an open source education company focused on
networking, programming, and servers. Our website and blog posts are all
open source, meaning you can learn from our content and use it to create
your own projects.

At Sidings Media, we're passionate about learning and sharing our
knowledge with others. We believe that everyone should have access to
high-quality educational resources.

Sidings Media was founded by Mattie Nickson, a self-taught IT
enthusiast with a passion for sharing knowledge and learning from
others. Mattie started Sidings Media as a hobby project to document his
own learning journey and to create a platform for sharing his knowledge
with others.

We started our homelab with a humble Raspberry Pi, but it soon
snowballed into something much bigger. We started using old enterprise
network equipment that we got our hands on, and we set up our own mini
data center right in our garage.

We love to share what we learn in our homelab. We believe that everyone
should have access to the kind of hands-on experience that we get in our
homelab, and we hope that our experiments inspire you to create your own
tech playground.
